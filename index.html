                        <br/>
                        <br/>I have spent the last few days reviewing possible solutions and going through the example websites you mentioned.
                        <br/>
                        <br/> I have proposed two different design directions below. </p>

<label for='firstChoice'><big>Option 1A:</big> This is my first choice of layout. The idea is to keep the design minimal and the typeface modern. A simple slider along the top for features and then list of videos along with a write up.</label>

                                Removing audio from movie files can be easily done with dedicated software. There are plenty fo free options to do this.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The archive page might be a bit difficult to organise by day since most archive organise their content by month. One option I found that might be able to solve this problem looks <a href='http://www.prelovac.com/vladimir/archive-spec/'>like this</a>. Clicking on any of the dates then releases a drop down with all the posts for that day.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Translating themes into hindi can be done but I have never done it before. Perhaps a more practical solution would be to create a seperate subsite in hindi and post hindi content to that site rather than trying to automatically translate content on the english site.
                            </li>

                            <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

    <br/> If there is no design, no development and no writing involved in this project. You will just be installing a wordpress template. All you have to pay for is the theme (approximately x) setup charges(y). This includes one year of hosting at 512MB Memory,
1 Core Processor, 20GB SSD Disk and 1TB Transfer. You will need to cover any traffic above this base amount.
<br/>
<br/>
If you would like me involved beyond installing a wordpress theme we can this on an hourly basis. I usually charge x per hour.
