            <h2>Hello,</h2>
            <br/>
            <p> I’ve been working hard over the past 10 days trying to reimagine Beeminder so that it is easier to use. I have tried to redesign as little as possible, only changing things when the usability benefits outweigh the confusion of changing what
              people are used to.

            <h3>Why Reimagine?</h3>
            <br/>
            <p> A sampling of pages from the current interface shows inconsistency in design elements across pages.</p>

            <br/>

            </a>
            <br/>
            <p>The need for stronger visual hierarchy coupled the variation in typeface sizing and spacing makes the interface feel like a collection of design fixes and additions built up over time. </p>


            <p>I have focused a single function for this proposal. Being able to sign up and commit money to a goal.</p>

            <p>
              Rather than tryng to reduce the number of steps to simplify the process, I propose increasing the number of possible steps by making each steps shorter and clearer.
              <p/>
              <p>
                I ran three twenty minute unbiased usability tests to set a baseline for the project. I gave each participant three tasks:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Task1: Sign up and commit to clearing out your inbox at least 4 days a week.</li>

                <li>Task2: Sign up and commit to walking 10,000 steps at least 5 days a week.</li>

                <li>Task3: Change your inbox commitment to 5 days a week.</li>
              </ul>
              <br/>
              <p> 0 participants were able to complete all three tasks in 20 minutes. What's worse is that rather than just not being able to accomplish the tasks, one participant silently failed, believing she had connected her gmail account when she did
                not </p>
              <br/>
              <p>I have put screen recordings of all three testing sessions into a dropbox available at the end of teh proposal, along with tester profiles and an executive summary.
                <p/>

                <p>The test revealed that the most salient problem with the user journey is that it forks at step 3 on the goal creation page.
                  <p/>

                  <p>Hick’s Law states that time it takes for a user to make a decision depends on the number of choices available — the higher the number the longer the decision time.
                    <p/>

                    <p>Giving users multiple options (to select a type of goal or connect a tracker service) before they understand the conventions of an interface is easily avoidable.
                      <p/>
                      <p>I have tried to minimise teh number of call to actions on each page by breaking up the sign up process into a simple progression of short steps. Further minimising potential errors by providing status indicators, an undo button and
                        feedback about the progress on each step.</p>

            <p>I've tried to reduce as many of the components on the page by coupling related functions together and providing a clearer sense fo hierarchyon teh page so that people knwo what tp look at first.</p>

            <p>Grouping relevant elemnets together and rearranging hierarchically also makes the site more accessible to keyboard only users people with vision impairments.

              <ol>
                <li> Navigation: Clicking on the logo takes you home, the dashboard button button takes you to the dashboard and everything else is collapsed inside the settings button.</li>
                <li> Progress Bar: Because the system is connected to a debit card, it is important to orientate users by explaining what is happening, what will happen, when it will happen and what they need to dp to prevent it from happening.</li>
                <li>Deadlines : Retroratcheting and deadline adjustment can be accessed by clickingon teh coundown button.</li>
                <li>Penalty Adjuster : Clicking on the amount button allows you to adjust your pledge.</li>
                <li>Refresh : Ideally clicking on teh image would refresh the data, of thsi is not technically feasable then coulping teh refresh button with teh screen make makes it easier for the people who tabb through teh site the refresh data when they
                  are accessing it.</li>
                <li>Add Data: If a tracking service has not been setup then adding data because one of the primary reasons for using this page. Being able to add data on the goal page as well as 'quick add' on the dashboard minimizes teh time people need
                  to spend looking for a way to add data to their goal</li>

                <li>Automatic Tracking : Coupling this function just below data add component allow speople to discover what kinds of services tehy can connect fi they havn't already tried a data tracker. If a service is connected the thsi changes to 'Turn
                  off automatic tracking'</li>
                <li>Stop; Pausing and archiving goals can be done trhough a single stop thsi goal button. This provides a singel point of focus for people that are panicing and just want to stop everything.</li>
                <li>Settings: All other page settings can be accessed through teh settinsg button.</li>
                <li>technical indicators: Labelling all additional graphs 'technical' means that people who want additional information will be drawn to it and people who are intimidated by teh syetm will stay away from it.</li>
                <li>Help; Using the footer for a single purpose menas that people know they can refer to teh footer when they have a problem. </li>


                <p>This why I have tried to </p>

                <br/>
                <p>When usability testing teh site I added a fourth task:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Task4</strong>: Cancel both commitments and deactivate your account.</p>
                <p>
                  Thsi task acnnot be completed. there is cirrently no way for someone to deactvate teh ccount. The reaosn I added this is is to see how long it would take someone to use the extensive FAQ and excellent support system you have developed.</p>

                <p> The results indicates that because there are so many link in there are footer users fail to associate the footer with any relevant purpose. I propose to use the footer as a support panel by providing a single 'help button' taht redrect
                  to a age with FAQ, Contact support and a link to teh forums. Other footer links match more conventional footer link names is that people who do use footers to use teh footer as a onventional footer are rediercted t teh appropriate location
                  </p>

            USING CURRENT THE CURRENT GRAPH

            <p>Another great universal design principle we love is Fitts’s Law, which essentially says that the time required to move and interact with a target area is a function of the distance and size of the target. The closer and larger the target,
              the faster the action. This is why we have increased the size of many UI elements, such as form fields, buttons, cards and links. Overall, it improves general usability (Fitts’s Law) and ease of use in touch-enabled platforms.</p>
            <br/>
            <br/>

            <a href='#'><img src='img/oldgoal.png' class="img-responsive same" /></a>

            <p>TWO TYPFACES</p>

            <p>The display font is Trueno Semi Bold. I wanted to select a typeface that was almost indistinguishle from you current logo typeface. I chose Trieno because of all teh options I shortlisted, this typeface’s letterforms had teh most space inside
              each of teh letters. Wide apertures and the large counterforms result make a text more readable.</p>

            <p>Because there is a lot of text block on your website I searched for a typeface that readable in large blocks of text. It needed to match the display type but it also needed to work as in all caps.</p>

            <a href='#'><img src='img/type.png' class="img-responsive same" /></a>
            <br/>

            <p>COLOURS</p>

            <p>I've used the slightest hint of orange and green for success and danger notifiers but otehrwise I have stuck to a Monochromatic colour palette. </p>

            <a href='#'><img src='img/colour.png' class="img-responsive same" /></a>

            <p>For most part, color is associated with specific actions: error states, primary and secondary button press responses and controls. This makes these prominent and distinguishable from other surrounding elements without relying on colour for
              teh site to make sense
              <p/>

              <p>Using color sparingly, and with a defined and limited purpose means you the site can be used just as easily with a vision impairments.

            <p>This proposal is deisgned as a starting point. The idea is to use your reaction to the dierction I am proposing as a way to build a clear brief for the project. I need to understand what you wwant fo rteh interface, what your concerns are,
              what kinds of design boundaries there are and limitations are on handling them.</p>

            <br/>I did not test the new interface and compare the results to teh baselien because I relaise there is probably not going to looka anything like I am proposing. I wanted to show you that there are usablility problems, and I wnated to show you
            how I would address these.

            <p> If you like the general design approach I have taken and you would like me to continue working on teh project estimate that it will take approximately 8 weeks to redeisgn you entire system. This woudl involve an initial convertsation with
              beeminder where gather feedback on teh proposal, listen to requirements and build an understanding of th brief for teh project. I will then Flowcharts for each possible user journey on teh website. One you are happy with Flowcharts I will
              tstart working on teh first round of wirframes, starting woth teh most critical user journeys first. I'm assuming teher will be 2-3 revisions on this process. Once you are happy with teh wireframes then I will start working on the final
              deisgns. I willshare deisgns as tehy are completed so that global changes can be made as early in teh deisgn process as possible. Once teh final deisgns are completed you will have two deisgn revisions. One for major changes nd one for minor
              changes and finishing work. The cost thsi work is as follows. You do NOT have to go for the entire package, you are wekcome to pick and match any any of teh deiverable. If you decide to pmove for ward the cost of thisproposal will be deducted
              for the follwoing amounts.

                For sutom deisgncomponenst I have just octicons for teh proposal. I dont think you need to redeisgn you r logo but just incase it was something you want to do I wanted to putthe option onn the table. Custom conmponents would include a new graphical language
                used across the site to indicate different types of content (symbols), actions and controls (icons), and even achievements (badges). Adding thsi option in will not take any longer because these will be deisgned in parallel an=s Iw ill
                be working with another deisgn agencies. If this interest you I can put together another roposal just liek thsi one jsut for teh logo an dcustom components designs. It will cost teh same as this porposal, it will take 2 weeks to deliver
                and teh cost of teh porposal will be deducted form teh project if you deisgn to move forward with the deisgn work.
