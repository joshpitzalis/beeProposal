                    <br/>
                    <p>After our conversation on tk, I understood that you need a new website fo rthe kautilya news network that allows you to post and share 3-5 videos a day and works incredibly well on mobile devices.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>I have spent the last few days reviewing possible solutions and going through the example websites you mentioned.
                        <br/>
                        <br/> I have proposed two different design directions below. </p>

                        Please <big><u>click on any screenshot</u></big> for a demo fo the site.</p>

<img src='img/firstChoice.png' class="img-responsive firstChoice"/></a>
<label for='firstChoice'><big>Option 1A:</big> This is my first choice of layout. The idea is to keep the design minimal and the typeface modern. A simple slider along the top for features and then list of videos along with a write up.</label>
                        <br/>

<img src='img/newsTube.png' class="img-responsive newsTube"/></a>
<label for='newsTube'><big>Option 1B:</big> Similiar to the option above but a slighty better layout for video content. No write up, less think tank, more youTube.</label>

                    <label for='newsSite'><big>Option 1C:</big> This last option is the most text heavy option of three. If you want the association to be closer to a news site then I would recommend this option.</label>

                                Removing audio from movie files can be easily done with dedicated software. There are plenty fo free options to do this.

                                The archive page might be a bit difficult to organise by day since most archive organise their content by month. One option I found that might be able to solve this problem looks <a href='http://www.prelovac.com/vladimir/archive-spec/'>like this</a>. Clicking on any of the dates then releases a drop down with all the posts for that day.
                            </li>

                                Translating themes into hindi can be done but I have never done it before. Perhaps a more practical solution would be to create a seperate subsite in hindi and post hindi content to that site rather than trying to automatically translate content on the english site.
                            </li>
